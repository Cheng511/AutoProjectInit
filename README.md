Introduction:
----
    This is my version of automatically creating a project folder, git init it, and also create a github repo using selenium. 
    Inspired by Kalle Hallden's "One Day Build: Automating My Projects With Python".
    However, I did do some changese here and there, mainly to make it a bit easier to code by myself.

If u wanna try...
----
    1. download: https://github.com/Cheng511/AutoProjectInit.git
    2. I suggest put the downloaded file in your cd ~ file (I'm Using Mac). Also, put .zshrc file on cd ~ individually.
    3. Change the username, password, and your desired filepath in .env file, remember to keep the quotation mark.
    4. turn on terminal and type in: source ./.zshrc
    5. btw, "code ." is for opening visual studio code. if you wanna do this, 
       press CMD + SHIFT + P on Mac when using VSCode, type shell command and select Install code command in path.

All you have to do afterwards...
----
    from anywhere in your terminal, just type in: create <project_file_name>,
    then the program will automatically create the file and repo for you.
